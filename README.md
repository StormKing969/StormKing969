### Hi, I’m Sajana 👋

I’m a passionate software engineer with roots in **Sri Lanka**, a childhood shaped by the island charm of **Mauritius**, and a journey that brought me to **Cape Cod, USA**, where I’ve been ever since. 🇱🇰 🇲🇺 🇺🇸

I love building scalable systems that blend clean architecture with human-centered design. Whether I’m diving into backend logic with **Spring Boot**, crafting dynamic frontends with **React**, or writing **well-documented code** that speaks for itself—I strive to keep things elegant, efficient, and understandable.

🧠 I enjoy turning complexity into clarity, and I’m constantly evolving—learning new tech, refining my communication, and building tools that make a difference.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me:
🎮 Battling it out in video games  
🎸 Strumming melodies on my guitar  
⚽ Smashing serves in soccer, table tennis, or volleyball  

I speak **English and French**, so feel free to reach out in either!

Let’s connect, collaborate, and create something awesome. 💬
